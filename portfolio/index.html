					<h3 class="title">Education</h3>
					<p>I was interested in computers from an early age and as such I chose to do a GNVQ in ICT during high school following by an AS level in ICT. I left high school after Year 12 and went to college where I acheived a National Diploma in IT, which is equivalent to three A levels. After college I went to De Montfort university in Leicester and graduated in 2013 with an honours degree in Computer Games Programming.</p>
					<hr />
					<h3 class="title">Career</h3>
					<p>My first job after graduation was as a Junior Software Developer for Sertec Group Holdings Ltd based in Coleshill in the Midlands. The job involved maintaining and upgrading the in-house software which controlled all aspect of the companies operation from Financial management to staff clocking in/out systems as well as production records. After working there for a year and 4 months I felt it was time to progress my career further.</p>
					<p>My next job working as a Process Automation Consultant for a new startup company called FSJ Consulting Ltd. During my 3 months working for FSJ I recieved foundation training in UIPath and BluePrism which taught me a lot in regards to using computers are roots to automate dull processes allowing people to do more practical work instead of the menial tasks. Unfortunately FSJ did not manage to keep the business coming in at this tiem and I was made redundant after 3 months.</p>
					<p>I then started working for Loop Technology based in Dorchester, Dorset, as a Software Engineer. Loop Technology designs, builds, and deploys bespoke robotic systems to customers based all over the world. I have used many different technologies whilst working for Loop Technology including PLC programming, KUKA robotics, Siemens PLC logic, WPF, WCF, UWP (Universal Windows Platform), C#, Javascript, jQuery, KnockoutJS, HTML, PHP, and SQL to name a few. Other technologies and APIs are sometimes learnt on a project by project basis, depending on what the project involves.</p>
					<p>As Loop is a small business that is growing quickly, there was an opportunity for me to redirect my career away from development and toward System Administration. I became the defacto 'IT guy' at Loop as people came to me when they had issues with their computers. From that I was tasked by the Director to implement a new network into Loop. This involved setting up a new domain controller, exchange server, data server, and active directory. Unfortunately, our existing network was running off of Windows Small Business Server 2008 which had no direct upgrade path to Windows Server 2016 which meant basically wiping the old servers and starting again.</p>
					<p>After successfully setting up the company's new network, I was given more and more IT tasks along side my responsibilities as Software Engineer. I took on the responsibilities of taking new hardware requests, obtaining quotes from suppliers, and then setting up the new devices once ordered. I also started to manage all of the devices on our network, making sure everythign ran smoothly.</p>
					<p>My biggest challenge to date was when I was tasked with getting Loop compliant to a level of Cyber Security known as DEFCON 658. This involved obtaining a certification called 'Cyber Security Essentials Plus' which involved an External and Internal audit. As Loop had very recently been a small company, there was not a lot in place regarding security apart from the standard anti-virus. It was a hell of a task, but I managed to get Loop certified first time. According to our assessor, Loop was only the second company, out of hundreds that he had audited, to pass first time!</p>
					<hr />
					<h3 class="title">Hobbies</h3>
					<p>My main hobbies and interests are gaming and restoring classic cars. I got my first classic car in 2013 which was a Mini Cooper 1.3i that I restored over 3 years to get it back into a great state. After that I obtained a 1970 MGB GT which is my next big project.</p>
					<p>Gaming has been a passion of mine from a young age and is the reason I went and did a degree in Computer Games Programming. Since university I have not worked in the games industry but have spent some of my spare time working on modifications for games and teaching myself games development in Unity as well as playing games.</p>
					<p>My passion in gaming has also led to me starting and running gaming communities in various games over the years, ranging from smaller groups of a few dozen, to large communities with over a thousand registered members.</p>
					<p>I'm also a bit of a tech nerd, if you hadn't have guessed, and like to get my hands on the latest bits of technology. As part of that interest i've been building computers, primarily for myself, for the past 15 years or so.</p>

						<h1 class="title">Web Development</h1>
						<p>Website development has always been a hobby of mine, it's something I've taught myself in my spare time for a good few years now. I started by developing simple HTML websites using solely HTML and CSS but have added new skills to my arsenal by adding PHP, Javascript, jQuery, and MySQL to my toolbox of web development skills. Along the way I've also learnt how to use CMSs (Content Management Systems) such as WordPress. For my personal websites I tend to create the site myself from scratch rather than use a CMS as It's what I enjoy, but I see the potential of a CMS so have learnt how to use them for cases where it is necessary to know how.</p>
						<p>As well as developing the website, I have also spent time learning about the hosting part of websites and have hosted many websites myself on pre-configured web hosting services as well as using a VPS to set up the web hosting manually through Debian 8.</p>
						<p>Examples of websites I have developed, or helped develop, can be found below.</p>

						<h1 class="title">Games Development</h1>
						<p>Gaming has been a passion of mine from a very young age. My first gaming experiences came from my Dad's original Gameboy and NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) but getting my own Nintendo 64 for Christmas. From there I went on to own almost every console since which is what led me to university to study Computer Games Programming.</p>
						<p>After university I have gone into more commercial programming, but gaming has still remained a passion which I have spent a lot of my spare time on.</p>
						<p>The core of games programming in my spare time has been spent more on modifications for games than creating games themselves. Though I have spent some time teaching myself Unity.</p>
